 secure coding review is a process of examining and assessing the source code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities and risks. This review ensures that the code is developed with security best practices and is resistant to common types of attacks. The goal is to prevent security issues before the code is deployed in production.

Here are some key steps in a secure coding review:

1. Static Code Analysis:
Use automated tools to analyze the code for vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, improper error handling, and unsafe input handling.
Tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, and Fortify can scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
2. Input Validation:
Ensure that input validation is implemented to prevent attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
Verify that inputs are properly sanitized, and validation is done both on the client side and server side.
3. Authentication & Authorization:
Check that authentication mechanisms (password policies, multi-factor authentication) are secure.
Ensure that the authorization process checks if the user has the correct permissions to access specific resources.
Ensure proper session management (e.g., no session fixation vulnerabilities).
4. Error Handling:
Review error messages for information leakage. Avoid exposing sensitive data like stack traces or system information in error messages.
Use generic error messages that don’t reveal the underlying system architecture.
5. Encryption & Data Protection:
Ensure that sensitive data is properly encrypted both at rest and in transit using strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256, TLS).
Review how keys are managed and ensure they are stored securely.
Confirm that secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt are used for password storage.
6. Secure APIs:
Review the code for secure use of external APIs.
Ensure that APIs are properly authenticated, sensitive data is encrypted, and input/output is sanitized.
7. Code Obfuscation and Hardening:
Verify that code and logic are obfuscated or protected against reverse engineering, especially for sensitive parts like authentication logic and keys.
Check for common security patterns (e.g., constant-time algorithms) to prevent timing attacks.
8. Dependencies and Libraries:
Audit third-party libraries and dependencies to ensure they don’t contain known vulnerabilities.
Make sure the libraries are up-to-date and regularly maintained.
Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check).
9. Access Control:
Ensure that access control is properly enforced for sensitive resources and that users can't escalate privileges.
10. Logging and Monitoring:
Verify that logging is implemented securely, and sensitive information (such as passwords or tokens) is not logged.
Ensure that logs are stored securely and monitored for unusual activity.
11. Security Best Practices:
Review the code for adherence to security coding standards, such as OWASP Top Ten or Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) guidelines.
Make sure the code avoids insecure functions (e.g., eval() in JavaScript, exec() in Python).
12. Penetration Testing:
